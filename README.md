# Machine-Learning-Topics
The creation of this repository is to track the code and files as I explore the fundamentals of machine learning

I am creating this repository to hold myself accountable and keep record of the topics covered. This will be useful to return to as I take on my own machine learning projects.

For the foreseeable future, I will be writing all code in Jupyter Notebook. All of the installation details like packages, datasets and references will be available in each specific notebook!
